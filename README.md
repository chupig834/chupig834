# üëã About Me

My name is Jerry. I‚Äôm currently pursuing an **M.S. in Computer Science** at the University of Southern California. I specialize in **Software Engineering**, **Machine Learning**, and **AI Automation**. I‚Äôve worked on impactful projects across industries: 

- **HikerHub**:
  - Develope a backpacking planning tool that optimizes gear packing and includes a community portal for sharing hiking routes and trip experiences.
  - Enhance the platform with AI-generated trip guidance, offering highlights, safety tips, and packing recommendations.

- **Ecommerce Automation ‚Äì Jadsy**:  
  - Build web scrapers to track weekly vendor pricing, improving cost visibility and reducing manual data entry by 80%
  - Automate end-to-end purchase tracking workflow from email to inventory using JavaScript and n8n, integrating with the EasyStore API to eliminate all manual data entry and ensure real-time inventory accuracy
  - Research and prototype chatbot integration to centralize customer messaging across Instagram, LINE, and Facebook.

- **Custom Machine Learning & Deep Learning Frameworks**:
  - Implemented core ML algorithms from scratch in Python, including KNN, Regression, Decision Trees, PCA, HMMs, Q-Learning, and Transformers, with a focus on model logic and training efficienty
  - Built and trained deep learning models using Keras and PyTorch, accelerating development and experimentation with high-level and low-level APIs
 
- **Machine Learning Projects**:
  - Diabete Prediction - Used Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict diabetes in females.
  - Fake News Prediction - Used Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Logistic Regression to predict fake news
  - California Housing Price Prediction - Used XGBoost to predict median house price
  - Loan Approval Prediction - Used Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel to predict loan approval status
  - Wine Quality - Used Random Forest Classifier to classify wine quality

I‚Äôm passionate about solving complex technical problems, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and continuously learning new technologies. Let‚Äôs connect for potential collaborations or networking!
